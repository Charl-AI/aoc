# Rust

We do the 2022 problems with the venerable rust!


## Rust Basics

Create a project for each challenge:

```bash
cargo new aoc-2022-XX
```

To build (compile) a project, `cd` into it, then run:

```bash
cargo build
```

Finally, run the code with

```bash
cargo run
```

## Command Line Arguments

Each challenge has two parts (a and b). You can select which part to solve by passing the part as the first command line argument. Supply the path to the input file as the second argument. All projects for the Rust 2022 challenges have this CLI.

```bash
cargo run -- a input.txt
```
