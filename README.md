# Ã©tudes

Practicing programming in public.

This monorepo contains the following projects:

- `aoc/` - advent of code challenges.
- `mnist/` - MNIST digit classifiers implemented in various languages.
- `sicp/` - exercise solutions for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

The only rule for this repo is that external packages aren't allowed.
I must implement everything using only the standard library of the language being used.
To run any of this code, it should be sufficient to simply install the relevant language.

This repo will always be messy and incomplete. So enjoy the journey, I hope it never ends.

Prior art: [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes), [etudes for programmers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1096892).
