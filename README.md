Advent of code challenges in various languages. Simply for learning new languages and sharpening my data structures and algorithms skills.

| Year | Language                  | Progress |
| ---- | ------------------------- | -------- |
| 2022 | Rust (2021 edition)       | 15 / 50  |
| 2021 | Lua (5.4.6)               | 5 / 50   |
| 2020 | Common Lisp (SBCL 2.1.11) | 0 / 50   |
| 2019 | Python (3.10)             | 16 / 50  |

Each day has two parts, with one star awarded per part -- the progress column above counts the stars achieved so far. Whilst solving the first part, I generally try to imagine what the second part might be and design my solution with that in mind. I am especially happy if the part b can be quickly solved using most of the part a code, without needing a refactor.

N.B. I am not requiring myself to tackle the problems in any order. I am simply using the back catalogue of existing questions and will solve easier/harder ones when I feel like it.

I am not allowing myself to use any external dependencies, so all that is needed to get started is to install the relevant language(s). Some brief notes about the language and tooling are included in the READMEs for each lang.
