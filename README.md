Advent of code challenges in languages I don't know. Simply for learning new languages and sharpening my data structures and algorithms skills.


| Year | Language                   | Progress  |
|------|----------------------------|-----------|
| 2022 | Rust (2021 edition)        | 7.5 / 25  |
| 2021 | Lua (5.4.6)                | 1   / 25  |


Each day has two parts, I give half a point in the progress column above if I only solved one part. Whilst solving the first part, I generally try to imagine what the second part might be and design my solution with that in mind. I consider the solution extra successful if part b can be quickly solved using most of the part a code, without needing a refactor.

N.B. I am not requiring myself to tackle the problems in any order. I am simply using the back catalogue of existing questions and will solve easier/harder ones when I feel like it.

## Installation

We include an `environment.yml` file for conda, `Dockerfile`, for docker, and `devcontainer.json` for VSCode/codespaces. This project uses multiple languages, but we stick to the standard library in all cases. You can therefore also install the project manually by simply installing the relevant version of the languages used.
