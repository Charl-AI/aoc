Advent of code challenges in languages I don't know. Simply for learning new languages and sharpening my data structures and algorithms skills.


| Year | Language                   | Progress  |
|------|----------------------------|-----------|
| 2022 | Rust (2021 edition)        | 7.5 / 25  |


## Installation

We include an `environment.yml` file for conda, `Dockerfile`, for docker, and `devcontainer.json` for VSCode/codespaces. This project uses multiple languages, but we stick to the standard library in all cases. You can therefore also install the project manually by simply installing the relevant version of the languages used.
