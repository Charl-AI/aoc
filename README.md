# Ã©tudes

Practicing programming in public.

This monorepo contains the following projects:

- `aoc/` - advent of code challenges.
- `mnist/` - a simple MNIST classifier implemented in every language.
- `sicp/` - exercise solutions for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

This repo will always be messy and incomplete. So enjoy the journey, I hope it never ends.
