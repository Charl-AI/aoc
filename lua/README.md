# Lua

The 2021 problems are solved with lua 5.1.5. This is the version that comes embedded in neovim.

Lua is a very simple language. It has one data structure, [tables](https://www.lua.org/pil/11.3.html), and 8 [types](https://www.lua.org/pil/2.html). Most data structures may be implemented through tables. Also note that the `number` type uses double precision floats to represent _all_ numbers.

## Running

Starting in the root of this repo, simply run:

```bash
lua lua/day01.lua

```
