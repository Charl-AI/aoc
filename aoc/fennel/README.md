# Fennel

Fennel is a lisp that transpiles to and runs on Lua. I am keen to learn a lisp, and the main reason I chose fennel is because I think the connection to Lua (which I am already somewhat familiar with) and neovim tooling should make it a slightly gentler introduction than going straight into common lisp.

Lisp is an old family of languages, often credited as the first to include conditionals, recursion, first-class functions, garbage collection, and more. It has a slightly odd syntax, relying on 'S-expressions' with lots of parentheses. The key thing that makes this syntax so powerful is that it does not need to be parsed into an abstract syntax tree. The language _is_ already an AST.
