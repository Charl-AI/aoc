# Python

We solve the 2019 problems with python 3.10. At the time of writing, this is the
language I am most familiar with.

## Running the code

All python scripts in this project have the same CLI. Run the code by using the
-q flag to choose the question part, and the -f flag to specify the input text
file. E.g.

```python
python day1.py -q=a -f=day1.txt
```
